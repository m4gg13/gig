      <description>When I started climbing about 3.5 years ago I picked up a pair of La Sportiva Finales at the suggestion of an experienced friend. Loved them so much for all of the years that I wore them!!!
Then, of course, the inevitable happened and I blew through the toes.
I began the search for a new pair of climbing shoes and went with a pair of La Sportiva Solutions because I wanted an aggressive shoes and they have a great reputation.</description>
